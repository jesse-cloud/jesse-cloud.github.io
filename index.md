## Welcome Jesse's Page!  

This is my GitHub page for my schoolwork in Data Mining at The George Washington University. 

[My first project](https://github.com/jesse-cloud/DATS-6103---Individual-Project-2---Jesse-Liu) is Analyzing Child HIV Prevalence Across Nine Different Countries of High HIV Prevalence, detailed below. 

### DATS 6103 - Individual Project 2: Analyzing Child HIV Prevalence Across Nine Different Countries of High HIV Prevalence

The purpose of this project is to analyze the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in children in different countries around the globe. In addition, healthcare spending per capita in USD will be compared to the prevalence of HIV-AIDS in children.  

**Details of the project:**
- Datasets used: "Key HIV epidemiology indicators for children and adolescents aged 0-19, 2000-2019" via [UNICEF](https://data.unicef.org/topic/hivaids/global-regional-trends/) & "Worldbank Healthcare Expenditure per Capita (Current US$) Dataset" via [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD)

- Countries with the highest prevalence of children (children 0-14 years old) living with HIV were chosen from three main regions: Africa, Asia, and South America. These countries are Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Haiti, Pakistan, Philippines, and Venezuela.

- Time period: 2010-2017

- Specific datasets analyzed: 
1. Estimated number of Annual AIDS- Related deaths globally (For all countries in the dataset)
2. Total Estimated Number of Children Living with HIV-AIDS
3. Annual New HIV Infections in Children
4. Annual New HIV Infections in Children as a rate per 1000 uninfected children
5. Healthcare spending per capita in USD

The different datasets were created using python
